# Capital City

Capital City is a project where I design a city-building/industrial-tycoon game. The player runs an industrial business producing and exporting goods, while keeping workers satisfied or subjugated.

It is inspired by the likes of Caesar III (et al.), RollerCoaster Tycoon, and to some extent The Sims.

## Current Plans

- Program new system for disease (incl. spreading from person to person in workplaces and houses)
- Make cemetaries to hold corpses in
- Make orphanages for children to be held in after parent dies (also: what happens if no orphanage is available?)
- Possibly make new slot-based inventory system for storage buildings

## Building Ideas

- Bathhouse: Reduces waste output from houses
- Hospital: Heals disease
- Library (req. Books): Provides entertainment, maybe improves education if that becomes a thing
- Gymnasium: Provides entertainment, maybe improves physical productivity
- Concert Hall (req. Instruments): Provides entertainment
- Allotment Garden: Produces food from nearby workers' free time (= 16 - WorkingDay)

## Mechanics Ideas

- Technology Research/Espionage (perhaps make other markdown file to describe)
- Productivity bonuses: fitness, education, anything else???
- Do children have special needs that adults/workers do not? Should education be provided by house or should children have to grow up with library access to be eductaed as an adult?
