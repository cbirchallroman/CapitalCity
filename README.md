# Capital City

Capital City is a project where I design a city-building/industrial-tycoon game. The player runs an industrial business producing and exporting goods, while keeping workers satisfied or subjugated.

It is inspired by the likes of Caesar III (et al.), RollerCoaster Tycoon, and to some extent The Sims.

I guess in this file I can talk about future plans and ideas :)
